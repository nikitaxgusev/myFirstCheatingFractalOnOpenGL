# myFirstCheatingFractalOnOpenGL
Sometimes I'm trying to explorer something intresting and I've explored the drawing fractal. 
I'm not in math. But I have two main things , the first one is getting the algorithm of bulding a fractal
and  the second one is trying to use OpenGL. It was new for me. (C++,VS15)
